# Personal Website Project Plan

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- ✅ Create a modern, clean personal website
- ✅ Minimal content, maximum impact
- ✅ Fast loading and mobile-responsive
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update
- ✅ Professional appearance for career/networking

## 🔄 Current Refactoring Plan (2024)

### ✅ Refactor Complete
- ✅ Visual design fully restored to original (cards, spacing, hover effects, titles)
- ✅ Data-driven structure: all content in YAML files
- ✅ Reusable includes for experience, skills, awards, and projects
- ✅ Clean markdown for About and Projects pages
- ✅ All spacing, hover, and button effects match original

### 🛠️ Maintenance
- Update YAML files in `_data/` for content changes
- Use includes for new sections/components
- Test locally before pushing to GitHub

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Continue to keep content and design in sync
- Consider adding automated visual regression tests for future refactors

## 🧹 Repository Cleanup (2024)

- Removed all legacy/demo/config files: `maps/`, `Appraisals`, `README.txt`, `LICENSE.txt`, `staticman.yml`, `tags.html`, `feed.xml`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Removed backup and fonts directories (no longer needed)
- Switched to Font Awesome CDN (no local font files)
- Removed all blog, tag, and comment system references
- Cleaned up unused/empty directories and files
- Now the repo is minimal, modern, and easy to maintain

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- Jekyll + Custom CSS + GitHub Pages
