# Backup - Previous Website Resources

This folder contains all the resources from the previous website implementation.

## 📁 Contents

### Original Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML file from the previous site
- `css/` - All CSS files including:
  - `style.css` - Main stylesheet
  - `style-desktop.css` - Desktop-specific styles
  - `font-awesome.min.css` - Icon font
- `js/` - JavaScript files:
  - `init.js` - Main JavaScript functionality
  - `jquery.min.js` - jQuery library
- `images/` - All image assets including:
  - Professional photos
  - Project screenshots
  - Autumn photography collection
- `attachments/` - CV and other documents

## 🎯 Purpose

These files are preserved for:
- Reference during the new site development
- Potential reuse of content and assets
- Backup in case we need to revert
- Content extraction for the new Jekyll site

## 📝 Notes

- The previous site was based on the Miniport template by HTML5 UP
- It was a static HTML/CSS/JS implementation
- The new site will be built with Jekyll for better maintainability
- Content and images may be adapted for the new design

## 🔄 Migration Plan

When building the new Jekyll site, we can:
1. Extract relevant content from `index.html`
2. Reuse appropriate images from `images/`
3. Adapt the CV and documents from `attachments/`
4. Reference the styling approach from `css/` for inspiration
